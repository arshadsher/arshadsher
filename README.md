- 👋 Hi, I’m Arshad Sher
- 👀 I’m interested in developing instrumented systems using hand held devices (phone and watch) for Stroke rehabilitation.
- 🌱 I’m currently working in "Aberystwyth Stroke Research Group" at Aberystwyth University. My work focuses on developing a smart, instrumented gait monitoring system for subjects with chronic hemiparetic stroke. Long term goal is to create a mobile app that runs on a standard smartwatch and a mobile phone to automatically and objectively quantify gait impairments in stroke patients, monitor their recovery in response to exercise rehabilitation, and investigate how improvements in gait impact their quality of life.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning work related to healthcare and data analytics.
